---Project Description---
This project is a simple cloud project where simple server-client transactions such as grabbing files and pushing files from and to the server are supported.  This handles a total of four transactions and proven to work on localhost.

----Limitations--------
* The list function works correctly on Michael's VM but not on Stanley's. 
* We get warnings on Stanley's VM but not Michael's. 
* mcput, mcget, mcdel & mclist need to be moved after compiling to another folder i.e client 
* serv needs to be moved to another folder after compiling, i.e server. 


---------Algorithms----------
We included csapp.c and csapp.h from the textbook and used the Rio functions readnb and readnitnb to name a few. From csapp we also used the Open_clientfd to open a port. 

To read from the socket we used the following methods. 
  1) Copy binary data into a buffer whose length is specified by the protocol.
  2) Use memcpy() to transfer the binary data from the buffer into a local variable.
  3) Use ntohl() to convert the binary data from network endiannes to the endianness of the local machine 
  4) Then we used the data to get to the desired method. 

* We kept data in a 2D array.
